# Define builder types
# You could define builders on its own file. Stevedore will look up for builders on the file set at 'builders_path'
# 
# examples:
#   1) Define one builder named 'infrastructure' which use docker as driver and current folder as Docker build context
#
#      builders:
#       infrastructure:
#         driver: docker
#         options:
#           context:
#              path: .

#
# Define images tree
# You could define an images tree on its own file. Stevedore will look up for images tree on the file set at 'images_path'
# 
#  examples:
#    1) Define an images tree that has one image named 'ubuntu' which has two versions, '20.04' and '18.04'.
#       The image '20.04' has two children: 'php-fpm' and 'php-cli', both having the version '7.4' defined. And the image '18.04' has only one child: 'php-fpm', with version '7.3' defined.
#       
#       images:
#         ubuntu:
#           18.04:
#             builder: infrastructure
#             children:
#             - php-fpm:
#               - 7.3
#           20.04:
#             builder: infrastructure
#             children:
#             - php-fpm:
#               - 7.4
#             - php-cli:
#               - 7.4
#         php-fpm:
#           7.3:
#             builder: infrastructure
#             builder:
#               driver: docker
